# GitKraken Readme fiel to test GitKraken
## The Purpose of this file is to test GitKracken

I used GitKracken in the past. I liked it for a couple of good reasons but moved on to test SourceTree. I liked my exp with SourceTree but after a couple of Issues I moved on to just using the command Line. There are a lot of Plus Issues with using a GUI for Git but it is not the end all be all of what it is that I do. There are going to be some issues going forward with some of the project I am working on and a GUI might be more helpful than not. 

### Objectives
- [ ] Does GitKracken make me more Productive?
- [ ] Does GitKracken cost to much?
